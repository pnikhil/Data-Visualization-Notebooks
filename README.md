# Data-Visualization-Notebooks

This repo consists of 2 visualization projects. One is for the World happiness data and other one for TMDB movie database.

- Graphs in TMDB project are interactive graphs created using Plotly library. These graphs will not show up in ipynb file on Github. Generated an HTML file instead for viewing the visualizations.
